            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                Dinapicso began with a passion for family portraits and community events. As demand grew for
                digital galleries, sports coverage, and custom kids’ albums, the studio expanded its services
                to meet the needs of clients looking for both quality and convenience. Today, our focus remains the same:
                create timeless images, provide a smooth session experience, and deliver results our clients are proud to share.
            </p>
